# Logic Proof Parser
This project implements a program that verifies whether a logical proof is syntactically and logically correct.

## How to run the program
- `./run_test` : Runs the test in `test.cpp`. Make sure to put `isDebugMode` in `helper.h` as `true`
- `./run_compilation` : Compiles and runs the program with `-Os -Ofast` flags. Make sure to put `isDebugMode` in `helper.h` as `false`
- `./run_profiling` : Runs a `gprof` profiling session and writes the output to `logic.output`. Make sure to put `isDebugMode` in `helper.h` as `false`

## How to access the Docs
- Open `DOX`
- Open `html`
- Open `index.html` file

> This project was made for the course CS F214 (Logic in Computer Science)
